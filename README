Configuration
—————————————

- first read the code of the helpers.
  (helpers are the runable parts)

- adjust to your needs, check nothing wrong will happen.

- use get.sh to pull something from your server.
    -> this is your working config.

- merge with 2.xkb :
  —————————————————
        Maybe you have to use the first section, the key codes or so from your conf ( hardware part ).
        1.xkb is what i first used to generate a config, but not needed.

- use generate to generate out.xkb to the same human readable format.
  If that works good sign.
  Code is formated and looks nice after that.
  Can be merged with 2.xkb to make code look nice.
  I used tool meld.


- be sure to have a way to kill or shutdown xserver, make backup, logout from nuclear powerplant control things or so, and save work.
  Maybe keyboard will not work after the following command, or something will explode because you hit the wrong key.
  Set the config with set.sh

- optional: check the install.py file, can be used to copy to homedir.

- optional: add entry to ~/.xinitrc like this: test -f ~/.xkbmap && xkbcomp ~/.xkbmap $DISPLAY

- if works config  done. else goto step 4 ( merge )
