Configuration
—————————————

- first read the code of the helpers.
  (helpers are the runable parts)

- adjust to your needs, check nothing wrong will happen.

- use get.sh to pull something from your server.
    -> this is your working config.

- merge with 2.xkb :
  —————————————————
        Maybe you have to use the first section, the key codes or so from your conf ( hardware part ).
        1.xkb is what i first used to generate a config, but not needed.

- use generate to generate out.xkb to the same human readable format.
  If that works good sign.
  Code is formated and looks nice after that.
  Can be merged with 2.xkb to make code look nice.
  I used tool meld.


- be sure to have a way to kill or shutdown xserver, make backup, logout from nuclear powerplant control things or so, and save work.
  Maybe keyboard will not work after the following command, or something will explode because you hit the wrong key.
  Set the config with set.sh

- optional: check the install.py file, can be used to copy to homedir.

- optional: add entry to ~/.xinitrc like this: test -f ~/.xkbmap && xkbcomp ~/.xkbmap $DISPLAY

- if works config  done. else goto step 4 ( merge )



Generate layout pdf

Manual
——————

Overview:

Shift, Mod3, Mod5 are the Modifiers.
Indicator lights show them.
Ctrl  and Alt ist free.
Shift + Mod3 -> Level 3
Shift + Mod5 -> Level 4
Mod3 -> Level5
Mod5 -> Level6
Mod3 + Mod5 -> Level 7
Shift + Mod3 + Mod5 -> Level 8
The Modifiers,
are on 980 and 432 on the number row.
Number row on not othogonal typewriter style keyboard looks like this: 
CA53SXXXS35AC
The 3 uppercase X are the 567-keys.
I want to use this layout on orthogonal keybords.
Because this and because the both "S"-keys are intended to be straight obove "j",
i spare out one of the uppercase X in the
following base Layout.
Uppercase X means not used.

CA53SXXS35AC           base level 
Tqwertzuiop:           T is Tab
assdfghjkl'"
yxcvbnm,.-XX


To understand it is usefull to read the part "mastermod" of 2.xkb
Ignore the part with the strings its not update.

Read the generated pdfs. Shows where are the keys.
